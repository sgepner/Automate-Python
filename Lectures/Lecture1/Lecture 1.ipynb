    "# Lecture 1 - elementary use of Python\n",
    "Through the course of your studies you must have committed some programing. this might have been a simple (or not so much) program in C, C++ or maybe Matlab or Bash? One thing that you might have noted is that in the case of **C** family a compiler was needed to build your program into a usable, machine code, binary executable. In spite of your (bad?) experiences with the compilation process and sorting out errors, the compiler was your best friend. It limited the number of errors, you might have committed that would have otherwise manifest in the working of your program. Some, you might have not even noticed.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there is a number of programming languages that do not require compilation, and use an interpretation engine to perform programmed tasks. Matlab, the popular in academia, suite is one of the possibilities. Here we will be looking at Python, a **dynamically typed** and **interpreted** scripting language that has by now become very popular in scientific, engineering but also in standard development applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Python program requires an interpreter to be run. An interpreter is a program that directly executes provided instructions, without compiling them into the machine code. This has some benefits, as you have no compiler errors, and might lead to a speedy development of the code. But also has some consequences that might prevent you from applying your interpreted code for complicated tasks.\n",
    "One very interesting application of interpreted programming languages, such as Python is in joining work-flow of otherwise separate tools, very much as the gray duct tape is used to connect various elements that have not been previously designed to be connected. Yes Python might be the gray tape that holds things together. During this class I want to share with you my experience of applying Python in such a role.\n",
