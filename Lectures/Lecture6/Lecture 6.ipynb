    "The ability to delegate certain tasks, or use external, already existing (C/C++) libraries to do work is very useful. The goal here is not so much to write meaningful code, but rather to present to you the possibilities that Python / C binding might give you. Essentially we will look at ways to call functions and pass date to  C/C++ from Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why would we want to do this:\n",
    "* We have a working C/C++ code we want to use.\n",
    "* We need the efficiency of execution of the compiled C/C++ code.\n",

    "## Passing data to and from\n",
    "The way Python and C/C++ store data is different. C does it very efficiently, and Python less so. Consequently Python integer is not the same as C/C++ integer and needs to be \"translated\". Most often this translation effort is up to you, meaning some code will need to be written, possibly on the both ends of the link. Still we are lucky as we get to use ready libraries for the most difficult tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This \"translating\" is called data marshalling. For build-in, simple types (floats, integers etc.) marshalling might be almost easy, for composite variables (structures and classes) it might be tricky.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Passing-by-value or by-reference\n",
    "You recall that when passing arguments to a function, by default C/C++ passes them as copies of values, so if you need data to be modified by the called function you need to pass the pointer to data, or in case of C++ a reference. Python in general will defend against giving you pointers, so writing functions that manipulate arguments passed to them might need extra work.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problems with memory\n",
    "In C/C++ memory allocated by the programmer must be freed by the programmer. Recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int));\n",
    "...\n",
    "free(p);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python all issues of managing memory is handled for us, and freeing happens by the garbage collector. Consequently we might need to ensure that memory used in the C/C++ part is properly freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C or C++\n",
    "<!-- The `ctypes` and `cffi`. -->\n",
    "In what follows we will be using `cffi` which is only compatible with `C` and has no support for `C++`. In case you need to work with `C++` have a look at `ctypes`.\n",
