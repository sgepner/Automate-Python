    "We will now use the tools we have learned to perform a simple study of a certain first order ODE problem. The problem comes from Spruce Budworm that has a tendency to periodically eat up fir tree forests in eastern Canada. The original research comes from Ludwig 1976 available here: https://www.jstor.org/stable/3939?seq=1 but is also discussed in a very good book by Strogatz \"Nonlinear Dynamics and Chaos\". \n",

    "1. Examine the problem. Try to determine fixed points of the solution.\n",
    "2. Solve the ODE for different initial conditions. Check what the solution approaches to.\n",
    "3. Prepare the solution surface as a function of system parameters and determine \"refuge\", \"bistable\" and \"outbreak\" states. Try out different initial conditions.\n",
    "4. Examine evolution of the system as parameters are slowly varied in time.\n",
