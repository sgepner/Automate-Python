    "## Task 1 (Dynamic typing) \n",
    "As you already seen in the Lecture 1, that, Python variable assignment is different from some of the popular languages like c, c++ and java. There is no declaration of a variable, just an assignment statement. Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesn’t know about the type of the variable until the code is run. So declaration is of no use. What it does is, It stores that value at some memory location and then binds that variable name to that memory container. And makes the contents of the container accessible through that variable name. So the data type does not matter. As it will get to know the type of the value at run-time. Enough being said about the dynamic typing of Python. Lets do a simple exercise:- \n",

    "2. Get the datatype of varible using type(arg) function (take variable name as argument).\n",

    "4. Now assign 10.1 to a and repeat the instructions 2-3 and observe the output."
