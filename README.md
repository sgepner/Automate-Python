# Automate-Python

Contains lecture materials and interactive notes for the `Automation of the design process with Python` class at the Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engeneering Warsaw University of Technology.

You can either clone the repository, and run it localy.
A good choice is to have VS Code with appropriate extensions or a full fledged Jupyter server.
