# Automate-Python

Contains lecture materials and interactive notes for the `Automation of the design process with Python` class at the Faculty of Power and Aeronautical Engeneering Warsaw University of Technology.

You can either clone the repository, and run it localy (you will need Jupyter to do that), or use this link [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/sgepner/Automate-Python.git/HEAD)

**Note**: I was only able to run Binder in FireFox.
